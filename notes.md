# CDN (Content Delivery Network)

-> A CDN can be used to deliver React applications to users more quickly ,safely, and efficiently
-> When you use a CDN, your React application's code and assets are stored on servers that are 
   located all over the world. This means that when a user visits your website, their browser will download the code and assets from the server that is closest to them. This can significantly improve the loading time of your website.
-> In addition to improving loading times, CDNs can also help to improve the reliability and security of your
   website. If one of the servers in the CDN goes down, your website will still be available because the code and assets will be available on other servers. CDNs can also help to protect your website from attacks by distributing the load across multiple servers.
-> To use a CDN with your React application, you will need to add the CDN's URL to your HTML file
